ps-bar-utils: A postscript library for drawing bar charts, with error bars
(c) Greg Benison, 2011

You use the file by importing 'bar-utils.ps' into a postscript file.
See file 'example-1.ps' for a demonstration of usage.

The API consists of the following functions (arguments given first, the way they would
be passed in postscript postfix notation):

<y> <dy> bar               % Append a bar to the graph of height 'y' and error 'dy'

         next-category     % Switch to a new category.  The value of /category-name will be
                           % applied as a label to the just-closed category.

   <msg> legend            % Append a legend entry.  <msg> is either a string or a procedure
                           % which draws some kind of label.

 <label> plot-label        % draw a label at the top of the plot

 <label> y-label           % Apply a label to the Y axis.  <label> can be either a string or
                           % a procedure which draws the label.

<delta> y-tic-with-interval % Draw tic marks every 'delta' positions along the y-axis.

In addition there are symbols whose definition can be changed to alter the plot appearance.  These
appear at the top of bar-utils.ps.  See the example for usage.
